## Assessment of Tethered Balloon-Borne Observations of Arctic Low Cloud Properties

Low-altitude clouds exert a major influence on the radiative energy budget in the Arctic region. Studies have shown that Arctic clouds contribute to warming of the surface through long-wave cloud radiative effect, except during the peak of summer when the cooling effect due to their high albedo dominates. Although low-altitude clouds remain one of the largest uncertainties in modelling the Arctic climate, our understanding of the thermodynamic processes governing these clouds remains incomplete. In-situ observations of cloud properties are scarce, and uncertainties involved in remote sensing observations make it difficult to precisely determine the cloud properties and the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere. To this end, we make a comparison between an in-situ observation of the low-altitude clouds using a cloud particle detector, and measurements taken from a ground-based remote sensing site (retrieved from CloudNet). We examine the measurements taken from the Backscatter Cloud-probe with Polarization Detection (BCPD) mounted on a tethered balloon to obtain the cloud properties such as liquid water content (LWC), size-resolved number concentration (NC) and polarization. The results from the  observation are used to examine the assumptions made in estimating the properties of the mixed-phase clouds from the remote sensor measurements.
